# Face-recognition-with-fisher-Discriminant-Analysis
The goal of this second part of the project is to build a new classifier such that given a  photo, it is able to determine whether it belongs to one person of our dataset, and if so,  which person. As a technique for dimensionality reduction, we will use Fisher Discrminant Analysis.
